\pard\nowidctlpar\s7\fi-360\li720\sb120\sa120\tx720 a.\tab Consent for Internet-Based Services.\b0  Because this software is a pre-release version, we have turned on some internet-based features by default to obtain feedback about them. These features described below and in the Windows 7 Privacy Statement connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. You may switch off these features or not use them. For more information about these features, see the Windows 7 Privacy Statement go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=104604. By using these features, you consent to the transmission of this information.

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-358\li1435\sb120\sa120\tx1437\cf1\ulnone\'b7\cf0\tab\ul Digital Certificates\ulnone . The software uses digital certificates. These digital certificates confirm the identity of Internet users sending X.509 standard encrypted information. They also can be used to digitally sign files and macros, to verify the integrity and origin of the file contents. The software retrieves certificates and updates certificate revocation lists over the Internet, when available.\ul\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-358\li1435\sb120\sa120\cf1\ulnone\'b7\cf0\tab\ul Auto Root Update\ulnone . The Auto Root Update feature updates the list of trusted certificate authorities. You can switch off the Auto Root Update feature.\par
\cf1\'b7\cf0\tab\ul Windows Media Digital Rights Management\ulnone . Content owners use Windows Media digital rights management technology (WMDRM) to protect their intellectual property, including copyrights. This software and third party software use WMDRM to play and copy WMDRM-protected content. If the software fails to protect the content, content owners may ask Microsoft to revoke the software\rquote s ability to use WMDRM to play or copy protected content. Revocation does not affect other content. When you download licenses for protected content, you agree that Microsoft may include a revocation list with the licenses. Content owners may require you to upgrade WMDRM to access their content. Microsoft software that includes WMDRM will ask for your consent prior to the upgrade. If you decline an upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the upgrade. You may switch off WMDRM features that access the Internet. When these features are off, you can still play content for which you have a valid license.\ul\par
\cf1\ulnone\'b7\cf0\tab\ul Windows Media Player\ulnone . When you use Windows Media Player, it checks with Microsoft for\ul\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-358\li1435\sb120\sa120\cf1\'b7\cf0\tab\ul Network Awareness\ulnone . This feature determines whether a system is connected to a network by either passive monitoring of network traffic or active DNS or HTTP queries. The query only transfers standard TCP/IP or DNS information for routing purposes. You can switch off the active query feature through a registry setting.\par
\cf1\'b7\cf0\tab\ul Windows Time Service\ulnone . This service synchronizes with time.windows.com once a week to provide your device with the correct time.

\cf1\'b7\cf0\tab\ul IPv6 Network Address Translation (NAT) Traversal service (Teredo)\ulnone . This feature helps existing home Internet gateway devices transition to IPv6. IPv6 is next generation Internet protocol. It helps enable end-to-end connectivity often needed by peer-to-peer applications. To do so, each time you start up the software the Teredo client service\b\i  \b0\i0 will attempt to locate a public Teredo Internet service. It does so by sending a query over the Internet. This query only transfers standard\b\i  \b0\i0 Domain Name Service information to determine if your device is connected to the Internet and can locate a public Teredo service. If you\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li1800\sb120\sa120\tx1800\cf1\'b7\cf0\tab use an application that needs IPv6 connectivity or\par
\cf1\'b7\cf0\tab configure your firewall to always enable IPv6 connectivity\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\li1440\sb120\sa120 by default standard Internet Protocol information will be sent to the Teredo service at Microsoft at regular intervals. No other information is sent to Microsoft. You can change this default to use non-Microsoft servers. You can also switch off this feature using a command line utility named \ldblquote netsh\rdblquote .\par

If you use an Accelerator provided by Microsoft, the information sent is subject to the Microsoft Online Privacy Statement, which is available at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31493. If you use an Accelerator provided by a third party, use of the information sent will be subject to the third party\rquote s privacy policy.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li1440\sb120\sa120\cf1\'b7\cf0\tab\ul Search Suggestions Service\ulnone .\~When you search in Internet Explorer by typing in the search box or by typing a question mark (?) before your search term in the Address bar, you will see search suggestions as you type (if supported by your search provider). Everything you type in the search box or in the Address bar when preceded by a question mark (?) is sent to the search provider as you type it.\~In addition, when you press Enter or click the Search button, all the text that is in the search box or Address bar is sent to the search provider. If you use a Microsoft search provider, the information you send is subject to the Microsoft Online Privacy Statement, which is available at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31493. If you use another (third-party) search provider, the use of information you send will be subject to the third party\rquote s privacy policy.\~You can turn search suggestions off at any time by using Manage Add-ons.\~For more information about the search suggestions service, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=128106.\par
